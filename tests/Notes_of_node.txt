-> the webBrowser won't stop waiting for the response until res.end() is called

-> req and res are readStream and writeStream objects

=> Loadong Modules in NPM
. When a request for some module is made how Node Resolves the path??
1-> start with core module
2-> search for developer modules if marked with ./ or ../
3-> if the file is not found in the mentioned folder then search for a file named Index.js
4-> Searches in node_modules/

=> What all happens when we require a module 
1-> Resolving and Loading

2-> Wrapping  Immediately Invoked Function Expression=> (function (exports,require,module,__filename,__dirname){
                                                            ....Code
                                                        })
*require->function to require modules
*exports->an expression for module.exports
*module->reference to current module 

3-> Execution by Node

4-> returning Exports 

5-> Caching  (Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded and also the results of some calculations by these modules also get cached)

console.log(arguments)
